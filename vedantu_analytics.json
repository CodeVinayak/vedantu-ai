    "question": "physics wallah vs vedantu",
    "answer": "Of course! That's a very common and smart question to ask. Many students and parents want to know how Vedantu and Physics Wallah compare. Both are great platforms, but they offer different experiences.\n\nHere’s a simple breakdown to help you see the difference:\n\n1. The Learning Platform & Technology\n\n   Vedantu: We use our own special platform called WAVE (Whiteboard Audio Video Environment). It’s built to be very interactive, with features like live quizzes, polls, and leaderboards that make classes engaging and fun. Our goal is to make online learning feel like a real classroom, but even better!\n   Physics Wallah: Their teaching is often described as more traditional, with a focus on a teacher explaining concepts on a board, which gives a classic classroom feel.\n\n2. Doubt Solving in Class\n\n   Vedantu: We have a special two-teacher model. This means that while your main Master Teacher is teaching the lesson, there are dedicated Class Teachers in the session whose only job is to answer your questions in the chat, right then and there. This way, you never have to interrupt the class or wait to get help.\n   Physics Wallah: Their approach to doubt solving may be different, often handled through other methods.\n\n3. Price and Features\n\n   Vedantu: Because of our advanced WAVE platform, the two-teacher system for instant doubt-solving, and other support features like personal mentors, our courses are positioned as a more premium, all-in-one experience.\n   Physics Wallah: They are very well known for their extreme affordability, making their courses accessible to a huge number of students.\n\nUltimately, the best choice depends on what kind of learning environment suits you best!\n\nIf you thrive in a highly interactive, feature-rich environment with instant support, Vedantu could be a great fit. The best way to know for sure is to see it for yourself. Would you like to try one of our free Master Classes to experience a live session on our WAVE platform?",

    "question": "what is refund policy",
    "answer": "Hello! That's a very important question. I can certainly help you understand how our refund policy generally works.\n\nOur main promise regarding refunds is called the Vedantu Improvement Promise (VIP). It's our commitment to your child's academic progress.\n\nHere’s a simple way to look at it:\n\n1.  Our Promise: We guarantee that your child will show academic improvement when they enroll in one of our long-term courses. If there's no improvement by the end of the year, we will refund the entire course fee.\n2.  Working Together: For this promise to work, we need a partnership. To be eligible, a student just needs to attend at least 75% of their live classes and complete at least 75% of their assigned tests. This helps us ensure they are getting the full benefit of the program.\n3.  Eligible Courses: The VIP is applicable to our long-term courses. It does not apply to short courses like Microcourses or test series.\n\nFor any cancellations or refunds outside of the VIP, the policy depends on the specific course you have purchased.\n\nSince refund policies can have specific terms based on your enrollment, it would be best for you to speak with a member of our support team. They can pull up your account details and give you the exact information for your course.\n\nWould you like me to connect you with them?",
